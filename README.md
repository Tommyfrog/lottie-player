A Lottie Player Block for Wordpress

A Lottie is a JSON-based animation file format that allows designers to use animations on any platform as easily as possible through static assets. They are often small vector-bassed files that work on any device and can be scaled (widht/height) up or down without pixelation. Here are a few examples:

In order to display lotties on a website, you need a player. For more info about the Lottie Player see https://lottiefiles.com/web-player.
I have now extended this as a Gutenberg block in Wordpress, which plays JSON files after uploading a Lottie.

You can download free Lottie files for experimental use, f.e.: https://lottiefiles.com/64152-car-animation
